# TaigaUI Workflow

## Previous notes

TaigaUI has predefined custom properties that set common styles for all components. Please review them if you need to change component styles on the global stylesheets.

## How to use a TaigaUI component

> First, find out if this component has been pre-approved to be used by UX and front team under the TaigaUI document on Cylon folder

If is approved, then import the component in the module:

```ts
import { TuiButtonModule } from '@taiga-ui/core';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ...
    TuiButtonModule,
  ],
})
export class ExampleModule {}
```

And use it in your component as you can see in the [documentation](https://taiga-ui.dev/components/)

```html
<button tuiButton type="button">Button</button>
```

## Overriding icons in components

TaigaUI comes with predefined icons for its components. If you want to override default icons and switch them for our own icons:

1. Ensure that the icon is added to our `sprite.svg` file.
2. TaigaUI expects a name of the icon in its properties, so you need to remaps its icons to our icons ID. In the example below, all taigaUI icons named `tuiIconSearch` will become our sprite icon with the ID `example`

```ts
const MAPPER: Record<string, string> = {
  // iconName: symbolId<Sprite>
  tuiIconSearch: 'example',
};
```

3. Use the icon in the component as expected

```html
<button tuiButton type="button" iconRight="tuiIconSearch">
  Disabled button
</button>
```
