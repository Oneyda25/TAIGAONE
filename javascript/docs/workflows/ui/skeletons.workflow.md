## Skeleton styles

It is possible to use the following classes on your page or component:

- `.skeleton-line-XX`
- `.skeleton-opacity-XX`
- `.skeleton-square-XX`
  To see the options go to `skeleton.css` and if you need another one feel free to add it.

In case you need to set pulseAnimation just add `.skeleton-animation` class to the container.

## Skeleton components

There are some components created at `libs/ui/src/lib/skeletons`.
